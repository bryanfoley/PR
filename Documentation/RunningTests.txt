The Plaxis Racer code contains two types of tests, Unit Tests and a Component Test.
To run the tests, simply change directory to the tests dir and execute:
	'python3 unitTests.py -v' 
to run the Unit Tests, and,
	'python3 componentTest.py'
to run the Component Test.

The Unit Tests will perform simple checks on the attributes and member functions of all classes, but these must be maintained
if there are new deliveries.
The component test, will check on the full behaviour of the class instances and the algorithm used to detect collisions between the objects.

Obsolete unit tests do not have to be deleted, they can be set to disabled via the decorator '@unittest.disable('reason here')' above the 
unit test class definition.

The component test should never be disabled as it is the overall check of functionality. Tests can be altered but never disabled.

A successful run of all enabled test cases is required before commit and integration.
